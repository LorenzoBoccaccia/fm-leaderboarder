## Introduction
There's no one-fit-all leaderboard. `FM-Leaderboard-er` will allow you to find the best LLM for your own business use case based on your own tasks, prompts, and data. 

## Features:
1. *Tasks* - Example notebooks for common tasks like Summarization, Classification, and RAG (coming soon).
2. *Models* -  Amazon Bedrock, OpenAI, any API (with a code integration).
3. *Metrics* - Built-in metrics per task + custom metrics (via a code integration).
4. *Latency* - Latency metric per model
5. *Cost* - comparison.
6. *Prompt* - You could compare several prompts across one model
